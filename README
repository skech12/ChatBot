Interactive Multi-Functional Python Tool
==========================================

Overview
--------
This project is an interactive Python application that performs several tasks, including:

- Conversational Interface:
  Responds to natural language queries (e.g., "how are you?" or "I'm feeling great!") with context-aware responses.

- Website Launching:
  Extracts website domains and search queries from user input and opens the corresponding website using your default web browser.

- Wikipedia Integration:
  Searches Wikipedia for a query and retrieves the title and a summary of the first article found.

- Text Processing & Story Generation:
  • Processes a file (testdata.txt) using regex-based text replacement.
  • Extracts variables from user input.
  • Rewrites a story template (template.txt) by matching candidate sentences from a file (Stories.txt).
  • Generates a customized story when the user types commands such as "write a story", "make me a story", or "rewrite".

Features
--------
- Conversational Processing:
  • Handles "how" questions and "I'm" statements.
  • Uses randomized responses to add variety to interactions.

- Website Search & Launching:
  • Detects website domains (e.g., example.com) in user input.
  • Opens the specified domain (with an optional query) in the web browser.

- Wikipedia Search:
  • Leverages Wikipedia's API to search for articles.
  • Displays the title and a truncated summary of the first matching article.

- Advanced Text Replacement & Story Generation:
  • Processes testdata.txt using regex replacements.
  • Extracts names and other variables from user input.
  • Matches and replaces parts of a story template (template.txt) with candidate sentences from Stories.txt.
  • Generates a customized story based on the processed template.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.x
- Python Libraries:
  • requests
  • webbrowser
  • random
  • re

- Input Files:
  Place the following input files in the same folder as the script:
    - testdata.txt
    - template.txt
    - Stories.txt

Installation & Usage
----------------------
1. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already.

2. Install the required libraries (if not already installed) by running:
      pip install requests

3. Place the input files (testdata.txt, template.txt, and Stories.txt) in the same folder as the script.

4. Run the script:
      python your_script_name.py

5. Interact with the program:
   - Enter conversational queries such as "how are you?" or "I'm feeling great!".
   - To open a website, type commands like "search example.com for news".
   - To generate a story, type commands such as "write a story", "make me a story", or "rewrite".
